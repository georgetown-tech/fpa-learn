# Getting Started with "Hello World" in JavaScript

JavaScript, often referred to as the language of the web, is a versatile and powerful tool used for creating interactive websites and web applications. It serves as the backbone of modern web development. Let's begin our journey into JavaScript with a classic: the "Hello World" program.

## What is "Hello World"?

"Hello World" is a time-honored tradition in programming. It's a simple introductory program that displays the phrase "Hello, World!" on the screen. While it may seem basic, it's a fundamental first step for beginners to grasp the syntax and structure of a programming language.

## Writing "Hello World" in JavaScript

In JavaScript, you can create a "Hello World" program with just a single line of code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Here's a breakdown of this line:

- `console` refers to the console object, which provides access to the browser's debugging console.
- `log()` is a method of the console object used to display messages or data in the console.
- `'Hello, World!'` is the text string that will be displayed in the console.

## Understanding the Code

The `console.log()` statement is commonly used for debugging and displaying information while developing JavaScript applications. In this case, it outputs the specified text to the console.
